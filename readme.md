## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated, **TypeScript-based bot** designed to automate token swaps on **EVM-compatible testnet environments**.  
It mimics the behavior of a manual user by leveraging the DEX's **multicall** function ‚Äî making it a powerful tool for:

- üß™ Protocol testing  
- üõ† Development workflows  
- üéØ Advanced airdrop farming simulations  

The bot is **configurable**, **type-safe**, and handles on-chain interactions securely and efficiently using **Ethers.js**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ **Dynamic Task Queue** ‚Äì Configure multiple token swaps to run sequentially.  
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Mimics dApp Behavior** ‚Äì Uses the DEX‚Äôs multicall so transactions look like they came from the official UI.  
- ‚õΩ **Automated Gas Fees** ‚Äì Fetches current network gas prices (`EIP-1559`) dynamically.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Configurable Delays** ‚Äì Add delays between swaps to simulate real user actions.  
- üîí **Secure Key Management** ‚Äì Store private keys safely in `.env` files.  
- üí™ **Type-Safe** ‚Äì Written 100% in TypeScript for maximum safety.  

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** ‚Äì Robust, scalable, type-safe  
- **Node.js** ‚Äì JavaScript runtime  
- **Ethers.js** ‚Äì Ethereum blockchain interactions  
- **ts-node** ‚Äì Run TypeScript directly  

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)  
- npm or yarn  
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any code editor  

You‚Äôll also need:

- An **EVM-compatible burner wallet** (‚ö†Ô∏è never use your main wallet)  
- Some **testnet tokens** (e.g., Sepolia ETH, XOS) to pay gas fees  

---

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/syaifmaxl/bot-swap-testnet.git](https://github.com/syaifmaxl/bot-swap-testnet.git)
    cd bot-swap-testnet
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create and configure the environment file:**
    Copy the example file to create your own configuration file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your RPC URL and private key.
    ```env
    # Your Testnet RPC URL from a provider like Alchemy or Infura
    RPC_URL="[https://testnet-rpc.xoscan.io](https://testnet-rpc.xoscan.io)"

    # The private key from your DEDICATED BURNER WALLET
    PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot's entire behavior is controlled by the `src/tasks.ts` file. This is where you define which tokens to swap and in what amounts.

The `SWAP_TASKS` array holds a list of swap operations. Each task object must conform to the `SwapTask` interface.

```typescript
export interface SwapTask {
  taskName: string;
  tokenIn: Token;
  tokenOut: Token;
  amountIn: string;
}
```
**Example tasks.ts Configuration**

This example configures the bot to swap 0.01 of the native token (XOS) for the BONK token.

```typescript
// src/tasks.ts
const SWAP_TASKS: SwapTask[] = [
  {
    taskName: "Swap XOS for BONK (via Multicall)",
    
    // IMPORTANT: For native token swaps (XOS, ETH), `tokenIn` must be the
    // address of the WRAPPED native token (WXOS, WETH). The bot sends the
    // native token as `value`, but the router's path requires the wrapped address.
    tokenIn: { 
      address: "0x291d66453dbab30a74422e142823a49a14d320d9", // WXOS Address
      symbol: "WXOS", 
      decimals: 18 
    },
    
    tokenOut: { 
      address: "0x00309602f7977d45322279c4dd5cf61d16fd061b", // BONK Address
      symbol: "BONK", 
      decimals: 18 
    },

    // This is the amount of the NATIVE token (XOS) to be sent with the transaction.
    amountIn: "0.01", 
  },
  // You can add more swap tasks here. They will run sequentially.
];

export default SWAP_TASKS;
```
Note: Remember to use all-lowercase addresses for both the router and tokens to avoid potential checksum errors.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

Once your .env and tasks.ts files are configured, start the bot with:

```bash
npm start
```
The bot will initialize, connect to your wallet, and begin executing the defined tasks, with detailed logs printed to your console.

**ü§î Troubleshooting**

- `bad address checksum` Error: This error occurs if an address has mixed-case capitalization that doesn't conform to the EIP-55 standard. Solution: Ensure all addresses in `swap.ts` and `tasks.ts` are in lowercase.

- `could not decode result data (getAmountsOut)` Error: This means the DEX router's price-check function is failing or doesn't support the token pair. Solution: The bot is already configured to bypass this check by setting `amountOutMin` to `0`. This is safe for testnets but should never be done on mainnet.

- Transaction Fails / Reverts: The most common cause is a lack of liquidity for the token pair on the testnet DEX. Solution: Before adding a task, go to the DEX's web interface and manually verify that you can perform the swap. Only configure the bot with pairs that are confirmed to have liquidity.
