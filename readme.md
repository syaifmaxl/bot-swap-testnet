## üìñ Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated, **TypeScript-based bot** designed to automate token swaps on **EVM-compatible testnet environments**. 
It mimics the behavior of a manual user by leveraging the DEX's **multicall** function ‚Äî making it a powerful tool for:

- üß™ Protocol testing 
- üõ† Development workflows 
- üéØ Advanced airdrop farming simulations 

The bot is **configurable**, **type-safe**, and handles on-chain interactions securely and efficiently using **Ethers.js**.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚ôæÔ∏è **Continuous & Randomized Execution**: Runs in an infinite loop, randomly selecting a task from your configuration file in each cycle to better simulate human activity.
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Mimics dApp Behavior**: Uses the DEX‚Äôs `multicall` function so transactions look like they came from the official UI, crucial for airdrop eligibility.
- ‚õΩ **Automated Gas Fees**: Fetches current network gas prices (`EIP-1559`) dynamically for optimal transaction costs.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Randomized Delays**: Automatically waits for a random duration between swaps within a configurable range (e.g., 2 to 5 minutes) to avoid predictable, bot-like patterns.
- üìã **Dynamic Task Queue**: Easily define a list of different token swaps for the bot to choose from.
- üîí **Secure Key Management**: Store private keys safely in `.env` files, keeping them separate from the source code.
- üí™ **Type-Safe**: Written 100% in TypeScript for maximum safety and developer experience.

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: For robust, scalable, and type-safe code.
- **Node.js**: As the JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Ethers.js (v6)**: A complete and modern library for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.
- **ts-node**: To execute TypeScript files directly.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) 
- npm or yarn 
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any code editor 

You‚Äôll also need:
- An **EVM-compatible burner wallet** (‚ö†Ô∏è never use your main wallet).
- Some **testnet tokens** (e.g., Sepolia ETH, XOS) to pay gas fees.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/syaifmaxl/bot-swap-testnet.git](https://github.com/syaifmaxl/bot-swap-testnet.git)
    cd bot-swap-testnet
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create and configure the environment file:**
    Copy the example file to create your own configuration file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your RPC URL and private key.
    ```env
    # Your Testnet RPC URL from a provider like Alchemy or Infura
    RPC_URL="[https://testnet-rpc.xoscan.io](https://testnet-rpc.xoscan.io)"

    # The private key from your DEDICATED BURNER WALLET
    PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The bot's behavior is primarily controlled by two files: `swap.ts` (for delay settings) and `tasks.ts` (for swap targets).

### 1. Randomized Delay (`src/swap.ts`)

Open `src/swap.ts` and adjust the `minDelayMinutes` and `maxDelayMinutes` variables inside the `main()` function to control the random wait time between transactions.

```typescript
// src/swap.ts -> inside main()

const minDelayMinutes = 2; // Minimal delay 2 minutes
const maxDelayMinutes = 5; // Maximum delay 5 minutes
```


**Example tasks.ts Configuration**

This example configures the bot to swap 0.01 of the native token (XOS) for the BONK token.

```typescript
// src/tasks.ts
const SWAP_TASKS: SwapTask[] = [
  {
    taskName: "Swap XOS for BONK (via Multicall)",
    
    // IMPORTANT: For native token swaps (XOS, ETH), `tokenIn` must be the
    // address of the WRAPPED native token (WXOS, WETH). The bot sends the
    // native token as `value`, but the router's path requires the wrapped address.
    tokenIn: { 
      address: "0x291d66453dbab30a74422e142823a49a14d320d9", // WXOS Address
      symbol: "WXOS", 
      decimals: 18 
    },
    
    tokenOut: { 
      address: "0x00309602f7977d45322279c4dd5cf61d16fd061b", // BONK Address
      symbol: "BONK", 
      decimals: 18 
    },

    // This is the amount of the NATIVE token (XOS) to be sent with the transaction.
    amountIn: "0.01", 
  },
  // You can add more swap tasks here. They will run sequentially.
];

export default SWAP_TASKS;
```
Note: Remember to use all-lowercase addresses for both the router and tokens to avoid potential checksum errors.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot

Once your .env and tasks.ts files are configured, start the bot with:

```bash
npm start
```
The bot will initialize, connect to your wallet, and begin executing the defined tasks, with detailed logs printed to your console.

**ü§î Troubleshooting**

- `bad address checksum` Error: This error occurs if an address has mixed-case capitalization that doesn't conform to the EIP-55 standard. Solution: Ensure all addresses in `swap.ts` and `tasks.ts` are in lowercase.

- `could not decode result data (getAmountsOut)` Error: This means the DEX router's price-check function is failing or doesn't support the token pair. Solution: The bot is already configured to bypass this check by setting `amountOutMin` to `0`. This is safe for testnets but should never be done on mainnet.

- Transaction Fails / Reverts: The most common cause is a lack of liquidity for the token pair on the testnet DEX. Solution: Before adding a task, go to the DEX's web interface and manually verify that you can perform the swap. Only configure the bot with pairs that are confirmed to have liquidity.
